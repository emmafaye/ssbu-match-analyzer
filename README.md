Replay Analyzer for Smash Ultimate is for content-creators, shoutcasters, professionals, and casuals seeking to improve their content delivery and reviews of replays. This project was born out of Nintendo's lack of support for a user-friendly replay viewer that allows easy sharing and review.

## Features

* Feed-in your recordings from your capture card or stream
* Auto-cut the video into it's relevant matches and sets
* Allows for easy review and sharing of matches through YouTube
