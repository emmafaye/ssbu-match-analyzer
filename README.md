Replay Analyzer for Smash Ultimate is for content-creators, shoutcasters, professional's and casuals to improve their content delivery and reviews of replays. This project was born out of Nintendo's lack of support for a user-friendly replay viewer that allows easy sharing and review.

* Allows for easy review and sharing of matches through YouTube
